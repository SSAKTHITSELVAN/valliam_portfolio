===================


Brand Style Kit Concept: "Precision & Future-Ready"
1. Core Identity
The Logo: The black "VM" icon on a white background. This high-contrast look signals authority, clarity, and modern engineering.

Company Name: Valliam Technical Centre and Services Pvt Ltd
(Valliam in red color like bosh logo)

Industry Positioning: Hard-tech engineering. Your services range from "Edge AI" and "Next-Gen Mobility" to deep engineering like "Autosar" and "ECU Software Platform".

2. Color Palette
Since you moved to a black-and-white base, we need an Accent Color to highlight specific technologies (like distinguishing "Technology Solutions" from "Engineering Services").

Primary:

Carbon Black (#000000): Used for the Logo, Headings, and Primary Text.

Pure White (#FFFFFF): Backgrounds, negative space (clean lab feel).

Suggested Accents (Choose one):

Option A (Tech Blue): Electric Blue (#007BFF) – Represents "Connectivity" and "IoT Cloud".

Option B (Safety Orange): International Orange (#FF4F00) – Represents "FuSa" (Functional Safety) and industrial caution.

Option C (Cyber Green): Neon Green (#39FF14) – Represents "Edge AI" and "Low Power AI."

3. Typography
To match the sharp angles of the "M" logo and the technical nature of "Linux/Android/RTOS Porting", the fonts should be sans-serif and geometric.

Headlines (Bold & Geometric): Exo 2 or Montserrat.

Usage: "Next-Gen Mobility", "Engineering Services".

Body Text (Clean & Legible): Inter or Roboto.

Usage: Descriptions of "Verification and Validation" or "Process Compliance".

4. Graphic Elements & Motifs
Based on your service list, your visual branding should use:

Wireframes: Since you offer "Digital Twins", use thin wireframe 3D object graphics in the background.

Circuit Nodes: To represent "IoT" and "Connectivity", use connected dot-and-line patterns.

Hexagons: Often used in "Cybersecurity" branding to denote strength and structure.

5. Tagline Ideas
Based on the service table, here are three tagline options:

“Bridging Edge AI and Next-Gen Mobility.”

“From POC to Production: Full-Cycle Engineering.” (Referencing your "POC" and "R&D/Co-Innovation Lab" services).

“Intelligent Embedded Solutions.”
